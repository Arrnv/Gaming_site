# 🏆 Award-Winning Website Clone (Zentry-Inspired)

This project is a **clone of the Zentry-inspired website**, built by following the amazing step-by-step tutorial from [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) — specifically [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9r5zTllx4). All credits for the original design and project structure go to the creators.

> ⚠️ **Note:** I followed the tutorial exactly as it was — I didn’t add any of my own creative design or UX changes, because I’m still learning and I’m not a designer. This project is meant purely for practice and learning.
